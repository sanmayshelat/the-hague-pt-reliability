From: S Shelat, O Cats, N van Oort, JWC van Lint, 2021. Analysing the Role of Waiting Time Reliability in Public Transport Route Choice Using Smart Card Data, 100th Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, Washington DC.

Waiting time has been consistently shown to have significant impact on route choice behaviour in public transport networks. Furthermore, unreliability in this component may cause frustration and anxiety in travellers. Although the effect of travel time reliability has been studied extensively, most studies have used stated preferences which have disadvantages, such as inherent hypothetical bias. In this study, we use revealed preferences derived from passively collected smart card data to analyse the role of waiting time reliability in public transport route choice in The Hague. Waiting time reliability is studied as regular and irregular deviations from scheduled values, and a number of indicators for the latter are examined. Results indicate reliability ratios of 0.20–1.12; relatively low compared to literature, potentially adding to growing consensus that stated preferences tend to overestimate values. Small coefficients in combination with the overall reliable service means that unreliability plays a small role in travellers’ route choices in The Hague. Additionally, behaviour in morning peak and off-peak hours is contrasted and difference in reliability coefficients for different modes in the network, and for origin and transfer stops are reported.
